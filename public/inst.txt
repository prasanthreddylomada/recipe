The first and foremost important thing to take care of while preparing chicken biryani recipe is, always use a heavy-bottomed pan as you would not want the chicken getting cooked.

The restaurant-style chicken biryani recipe uses the whole chicken in preparation and the chicken can dry when cooking at home. Always use chicken thigh or drumsticks.

If you want your chicken to be juicier in your biryani, do not remove the bone.

If your cooked rice has turned sticky, spread it on a plate and leave it for 5 minutes. The rice will be separate and fluffy again.

Freshly pound spices bring out the best taste in Chicken Biryani Recipe, so make sure that you dry roast all the whole spices for a good 2-3 minutes and then pound or grind them.
